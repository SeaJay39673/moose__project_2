# Description
    The goal of this project is to:
        1. Simulate a rectangular steel plate under thermal loading.
        2. Simulate a rectangular steel plate under mechanical loading.
        3. Simulate a rectangular steel plate under both thermal and mechanical loading.
    Each of these goals results will be processed and visualized in ParaView, focusing on the plot over line function. 
    These results will be compared to supplemental calculations to check the validity.

    The final part of this project is to create a Python script that can be used to plot the temperature of stress components or displacement,
    as well as find the maximum temperature/displacement location and magnitude.
